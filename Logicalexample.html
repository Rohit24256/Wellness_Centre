            <p>
                I recently read <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>, a classic novel that is widely studied in literature classes. In it, a character says, <q>Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.</q> The book also contains a powerful message that is best captured in the following statement: <blockquote>People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.</blockquote> The term <dfn>courage</dfn> is often defined in various ways. An example of an abbreviation is <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, which stands for World Health Organization. Meanwhile, <acronym title="NASA">NASA</acronym> is known for its space missions. In programming, a simple JavaScript line might look like this: <code>let x = 10;</code> To run a command, you might press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> on your keyboard. Sometimes, it's important to <em>emphasize</em> certain words for effect, but if something is no longer relevant, it can be marked with <del>strikethrough</del>. When new information is added, it can be marked with <ins>an insertion</ins>. Text of particular importance can be marked with <strong>strong emphasis</strong>. In mathematics, a <var>variable</var> might be denoted by a letter like x or y. An example of a system message might be: <samp>Operation completed successfully</samp>. Finally, you can reach me at my <address>123 Main St, Springfield, USA</address>.
